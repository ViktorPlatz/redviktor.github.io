  Key terms:<br><br>
    <b>Aktieindkomst</b> - 27% on the first 56.500 DKK (56.500 DKK in 2021) / 42% above that
    <br>
    <b>Kapitalindkomst</b> - 33% - 42,7% Normal income tax - similar to taxation on your paycheck (Except no arbejdsmarkedsbidrag)
    <br>
    <b>Lagerprincippet</b>- Assets get taxed at the end of the year - taxed on unrealised profits - taxation occurs yearly
    <br>
    <b>Realisationsprincippet</b>- Assets get taxed at sale (when profits have been realised) - taxed on profit
</p>

The amount the assets are taxed by depends on what tax rules it classifies under<br>

ETFs are always taxed through the lagerprincip, however some are taxed through aktieindkomst (Less tax - better than kapitalindkomst) and some are taxed through kapitalindkomst(edited)<br><br>

The ETFs on skat’s "positivist" are the ETFs which are taxed through aktieindkomst<br>

<h2>What should I invest in?</h2>

What types of investment products should be picked mainly depends on which account is in consideration:
<p>As the <b>Aktiesparekonto, Aldersopsparing, Ratepension and Børneopsparing</b> are always taxed through the lagerprincip, it would be most advantageous to invest in ETFs (for most people) as these investment products are always taxed through the lagerprincip. Dividend-paying mutual funds which are normally taxed through the Realization Principle does not apply in these investment accounts and therefore do not have any benefit to them.
</p>
<p>
For <b>frie-midler</b> (regular investment account) there is an ongoing debate on whether or not it is more beneficial to invest in ETFs (taxed every year) or danish dividend-paying mutual funds (taxed on sale) - The dilemma lies in the costs of the investment products. ETFs generally have lower expense ratios than danish mutual funds, the debate is therefore whether or not the more benefical taxation method can subsidize the higher expense ratios that comes with the danish mutual funds.

<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dkfinance/comments/hv82ll/en_gang_for_alle_om_etfer_vs_danske/">Some individuals have attempted to simulate a senario using real world data to find the superior method when it comes to the two strategies.</a>
<br><br>
<b>TL;DR:</b> The general conclusion is:
<br>
< 12 years : <b>ETFs</b> are better<br>
> 12 years : <b>Danish dividend-paying mutual funds</b> are better
<br><br>
This is a simplified conclusion as there are a lot of factors which determine which strategy is better. Some Danish mutual funds pay out a large amount of their returns as dividends, which also affects which strategy provides a better outcome.

<h3>FAQ</h3>

<h4>Which bank should i use to invest with?</h4>
<p>Different banks have different commissions when it comes to buying and selling stocks, also some banks don't have investment platforms and therefore makes it harder to invest with
   - some banks also don't have the option to make an aldersopsparing or aktiesparekonto - some banks also don't fill out tax information which means you have to do it yourself (Annoying and takes a long time)
</p>

<p class="message">

<h4>Which tax advantaged accounts should i fill up first?</h4>

<p>Generally, it depends on the individual person when it comes to filling up different tax advantaged accounts - This is due to some accounts locking in your funds until a certain date, such as your ratepension and aldersopsparing, where a fee is charged to withdraw your funds before the target date.<br>
  Fee to withdraw funds before target date (Retirement) (Aldersopsparing) 20% of all funds in the account<br>
  Fee to withdraw funds before target date (Retirement) (Ratepension): 60% of all funds in the account
</p>

<h4>What is a lazy portfolio?</h4>
A lazy portfolio is a portfolio which uses basic asset classes, normally split between bonds and stocks. These portfolios are passively traded rather than actively traded. Multiple studies show that passively managed portfolios outperform actively managed portfolios in the long run, and therefore is preferable. There are various different kinds of lazy portfolios, 
each adjusted based on fitting the needs of the individual investor. Most lazy portfolios generally follow a broad index and therefore do not take idiosyncratic risks of specific sectors or countries. This means the lazy portfolio takes on the market risk and therefore also the risk premium of the market- but not extra uncompensated risks.
<br>
<b>Examples of lazy portfolios:</b>
<br>
<b>One fund US portfolio</b> (This portfolio is not diversified over multiple countries and is generally <span style="color:red">NOT</span> recommended)
<br>
100% invested in a US total market index fund

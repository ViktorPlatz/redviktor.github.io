<b>Lagerprincippet</b>- Assets get taxed at the end of the year - taxed on the amount gained - if you buy a stock for 100 USD and the stock raises to 110 USD by the end of the year 
- you are taxed on the 10 USD gained at the end of the year(edited)

<b>Realisationsprincippet</b>- Assets get taxed at the end of the year - taxed on the amount gained - if you buy a stock for 100 USD and the stock raises to 110 USD by the end of the year

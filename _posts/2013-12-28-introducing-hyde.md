title: Who am i?
---

Hello, my name is Viktor Platz. This is a personal website which I have made to keep my projects in place and to showcase some of my work which I have created. I have also made a section where I can post things, which I plan on using for blog posts and journals on the projects which I make.

### Who am i? and what do i do?

I am a student studying software engineering from Copenhagen, Denmark. After graduating high school, I took a year long sabatical, to enjoy life and acquire some funds to invest with and prepare to start studying at uni.

During my sabbatical I,
* Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, [404](/404), [RSS feed](/atom.xml), posts, and [example page](/about))
* Created an [Investing Guide](/investingguide/) specifically made for people living in denmark.
* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
* Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
* Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
* Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)

### Hyde features

In addition to the features of Poole, Hyde adds the following:

* Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated navigation with active link support
* Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and [reverse](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#reverse-layout) (right sidebar), available via `<body>` classes
* [Eight optional color schemes](https://github.com/poole/hyde#themes), available via `<body>` classes

[Head to the readme](https://github.com/poole/hyde#readme) to learn more.

### Browser support

Hyde is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

### Download

Hyde is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde">GitHub repository</a> for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks!

title: Who am i?
---

Hello, my name is Viktor Platz. This is a personal website which I have made to keep my projects in place and to showcase some of my work which I have created. I have also made a section where I can post things, which I plan on using for blog posts and journals on the projects which I make.

### Who am i? and what do i do?

I am a student studying software engineering from Copenhagen, Denmark. After graduating high school, I took a year long sabatical, to enjoy life and acquire some funds to invest with and prepare to start studying at uni.

During my sabbatical I,
* Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, [404](/404), [RSS feed](/atom.xml), posts, and [example page](/about))
* Created an [Investing Guide](/investingguide/) specifically made for people living in denmark
* Started various coding projects
* Prepared for uni by networking with some uni students and branching out my network
* Started a youtube channel and racked up â‰ˆ100k views in the first couple of months
* Engaged with some economics students to try and solve some tax questions regarding tax optimization in denmark

### What is the purpose of this website?

Informative, entertainment, personal career marketing and most importantly, a good place for me to keep a journal, allowing me to reflect on different things in which I have done.
